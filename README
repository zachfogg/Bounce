Bounce is 2D 'game' based on Microsoft's XNA framework.
It utilizes the Farseer physics engine.

The goal of this project is to create a physics playground.
The source will be full of abstract tools which can be used to create more specific tools.
This way, any future projects will already have some groundwork code with which I'm familiar.
