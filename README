Bounce is 2D 'game' based on Microsoft's XNA framework.
It utilizes the Farseer physics engine.

The goal of this project is to create a physics playground in which I can simulate theoretical physical scenarios.

Controls:

Movement: WASD
Click to spawn a Metroid, right-click to delete them all.
F# keys toggle physics engine debugdraw flags.
Numpad arrow keys control the camera, + and - for zoom.
Spacebar will activate the motion of all metroids, which have seperate and random X and Y radius values by why force is applied.
